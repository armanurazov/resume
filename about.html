                    Ciao, my name is <b>Arman</b> and I am pursuing my studies at Seneca College as a Computer
                    Programmer. I
                    previously obtained a Bachelor degree in Business Administration and worked in large corporations
                    like Novartis
                    and ExxonMobil. However I decided to accept a new challenge and become a professional Software
                    Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My expertise lies primarily in Web development but also coding in C++ language. I am familiar with
                    the fundamental concepts of programming including <b>OOP</b> and software architecture such as MVC.
                    I feel
                    comfortable working on back end as well as front end development. I have strong knowledge of
                    <b>Node.js</b>
                    environment and <b>Express.js</b> framework, also <b>MongoDB</b> and <b>PostgreSQL</b> for database
                    administration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I fluently speak English, Russian and Czech languages. I would confidently place among my strengths
                    solid ability to analytical thinking and creative approach to things. I have proven skills of
                    prioritizing and time management. Outside my professional profile, I am active in my spare time. I
                    am a BJJ practitioner, also enjoy
                    playing soccer, skiing, hiking and travelling. Too-da-loo!
